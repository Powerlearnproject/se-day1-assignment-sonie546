# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. It is the Designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software using engineering principles to ensure reliability and scalability.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1950s-60s: Structured programming.
1970s-80s: Waterfall & Agile methodologies.
2000s-Present: DevOps, AI, cloud computing.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement Analysis – Identify needs.
Design – Plan architecture/UI.
Implementation – Write code.
Testing – Fix bugs.
Deployment – Release software.
Maintenance – Updates/fixes.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall – Sequential, for fixed projects (e.g., medical software).
Agile – Iterative, for flexible projects (e.g., mobile apps).


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Developer – Writes code.
QA Engineer – Tests software.
Project Manager – Manages timelines & teams.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs (e.g., VS Code) – Streamline coding/testing.
VCS (e.g., Git) – Track changes & enable collaboration.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Scope Creep – Define requirements.
Tech Debt – Refactor regularly.
Collaboration – Use version control & tools.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit – Tests functions.
Integration – Checks component interaction.
System – Validates full system.
Acceptance – Ensures user requirements met.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Crafting inputs for AI to improve accuracy and relevance.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
ague: "Tell me about cars."
Improved: "Compare electric vs. gasoline cars (cost, maintenance, environment)."
Why? More specific, clear, and concise.
